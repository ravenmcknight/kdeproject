VERY similar structure/content to class activity but more notation, more formal, and obviously no activities

# Introduction

- nonparametric
- relax assumptions
- intuition goes here for this type of paper?


# Proofs/methods/results/theory?? (not really sure what to call this)

this section is sort of a glorified literature review since we're not introducing anything new. 

## initial KDE results

- discuss Parzen (1962) and Rosenblatt (1956) here: this is the basis of KDE

## Types of kernels

- outline the most common but we'll focus on gaussian

## Bias, Variance, and measures of MSE

- essentially just walk through the proofs, probably through asymptotic MSE

## Bandwidth

- most active field
- introduce optimization problem

# conclusion

- probably with an eye towards practical applications
